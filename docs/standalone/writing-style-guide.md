# Technical writing style guide

## General notes


Ensure simplicity, accuracy, and accessibility. Aim for a broad understanding,
even for select audiences. Be concise – readers are busy; avoid
unnecessary words.

### Style principles

**Language**

- Use American English: -ize rather than -ise endings, ‘color’ instead of ‘colour’
- Avoid slang words
- Use gender-inclusive pronouns – they/their/them
- Active voice, avoid passive.

**Abbreviations and acronyms**

- No full stops in abbreviations: eg, ie, PhD, etc, v (note, not vs), plc, Inc
- Write acronyms as said (eg, radar, laser, captcha), use initial caps for entities, avoid capitalization
- Minimize the use of acronyms and initialisms. Spell out on first use, eg peer-to-peer (P2P)
- Refer to the Cambridge dictionary.

**Legal and investment**

- Avoid investment or legal advice.

**Punctuation**

- Use the Oxford/serial comma
- Use single quote marks: 'cascading disruption'
- Use en dash – (option-hyphen on a Mac keyboard; Alt-hyphen on PC)
- Use a full stop at the end of the last bullet point.

**Capitalization**

- Lowercase for job titles, degree names, and university departments
- Use lowercase after a colon, eg 'Feature: this feature is about...'
- Book, film, and game titles should be in italics, and academic papers should
  be in 'single quotes' – avoid subtitles.

**Numbers and time**

- Spell out one to nine: one, two, three, four, five, once I caught a fish alive, except for percentages: 1%, 2%, 3%
- Use numerals for anything higher: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
- Spell out million, billion when in prose: there are nine million bicycles in Beijing
- Use abbreviations for money: £5m, $10bn, 12tn yen
- When talking generally, use MMMM DD, YYYY format, eg February 1, 2018
- For technical purposes, use ISO 8601 standard for dates and time: YYYY-MM-DD eg 2018-02-01.

**Bullet lists**

- Start with a capital letter and use full stops in complete sentences. You
  can format the bullet 'title' in bold if there is one:
  - **Feature name 1**. This full sentence describes the feature in more detail.
  - **Feature name 2**. This full sentence describes the second feature in more detail.
- Omit full stops in short itemized lists; use it after the last bullet point.
  For example, the discussed feature includes such items as:
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3.
- In shorter statements, full stops can also be omitted. For example:
  - Maintain uniformity across all documentation
  - Encourage user interaction with clear instructions
  - Incorporate visuals judiciously to enhance understanding.

**Links**

- Write clear and meaningful links; don’t use 'here' as a link. Always embed
  links; don’t just paste one as is.

**Headlines and titles**

- Headlines are 'Sentence case only'. The limited use of capitals is a way of
  avoiding confusion for proper names. Use initial caps for navigation section
  names and topic headings.
- No full stops at the end of headlines, pull quotes, captions, and other
  display matter, or when referencing figures: just 'See Figure 1 for details...'.
